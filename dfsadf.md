### Type Conversion

- **Conversion happens when:**
  1. **Types are compatible**: This means you can only convert between compatible data types, such as numbers (e.g., `float` to `int` or `long`). However, you cannot convert between incompatible types like `int` to `boolean`.

  2. **Destination type is larger than the source type**: This means you cannot store a larger data type into a smaller one, but the reverse is possible (e.g., converting `int` to `float`).
